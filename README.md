- Uniswap was created by Hayden Adams
- Hayden Adams was laid off from his job as a mechanical engineer when a friend of his, Karl Floersch, encouraged him to learn coding and to get into Ethereum. The general x*y=k formula for market makers on Ethereum that Uniswap utilizes was conceptualized by Alan Lu of Gnosis.

- The code for Uniswap was created from scratch and it was largely self-funded from its founder, Hayden Adams. Upon the realization that he was in the process of creating something great, and at the advice of Vitalik Buterin (Ethereum co-founder) and his friend Phil Daian, a blockchain security expert, he applied for and received an Ethereum Foundation grant of $50,000 plus the cost of a runtime verification.

## **Business Activities**
- Uniswap prioritizes censorship resistance, secuirty, self-custody and they function without any trusted intermediaries who could potentially restric access to funds or swaps. The Uniswap Interface is able to operate with 100% uptime because the Ethereum blockchain operates continuously so as long as the Ethereum blockchain is still operating the Uniswap Interface will continue to operate.

- Uniswap was the first widely-used permissionless decentralized exchange (DEX) that allowed users to trade between any ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum network. This allowed for trading without the need to deposits or withdrawals to a centralized order book.

- Uniswap aims to serve digital asset holders who prefer self-custody, high liquidity on their exchange and the freedom to choose from far more trading pairs that any centralized exchange can offer. Uniswap uses the Constant Product Market Maker Model (CPMMM) which allows them to always provide liquidity regarless of order size or the size of the liquidity pool.

- The main distincion between Uniswap and other DEXs is their CPMMM pricing model which allows for any ERC20 token to be traded so long as an equivalent value of ETH is added. Uniswap uses the constant equation of x * y = k where x and y represent the quantity of ETH and ERC20 toeks in the liquidity pool and k is a constant. This automates the pricing and maintains access to liquidity.

- Uniswap V3, which launched in May of 2021, allows for liquidity providers to create as many positions as they see fit, each with their own price range. This allows the market to concentrate liquidity where it sees fit.

## **Landscape**
- Uniswap is in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) domain.
- Bitcoin is commonly thought of as the launchpad for DeFi when in 2009 an anonymous entity calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto launched their peer-to-peer digital monetary system that operates on the blockchain. 
-In 2017, MakerDAO, an Ethereum-based protocol, allowed users to issue a cryptocurrency 1-to-1 to the United States Dollar by using digital assets as collateral. This allowed for anyone to borrow the DAI stablecoin against ETH, paving the way for decentralized loans. Lenders collecting interest payments no longer had to be financial institutions and borrowers no longer could be denied access to funds based on things such as credit history, country of origin or race.
