## **Overview and Origin**
- The company that created the Uniswap Portocol is Uniswap Labs. 
- Uniswap launched on the Ethereum mainnet on November 2nd of 2018 after over a year of development.

- Uniswap was created by Hayden Adams
- When Hayden Adams was laid off from his job as a mechanical engineer, a friend of his, Karl Floersch, encouraged him to learn coding and to get into Ethereum. The general x*y=k formula for market makers on Ethereum that Uniswap utilizes was conceptualized by Alan Lu of Gnosis.

- The code for Uniswap was created from scratch and it was largely self-funded from its founder, Hayden Adams. Upon the realization that he was in the process of creating something great, and at the advice of Vitalik Buterin (Ethereum co-founder) and his friend Phil Daian, a blockchain security expert, he applied for and received an Ethereum Foundation grant of $50,000 plus the cost of a runtime verification.

## **Business Activities**
- Uniswap prioritizes censorship resistance, secuirty, self-custody and they function without any trusted intermediaries who could potentially restric access to funds or swaps. The Uniswap Interface is able to operate with 100% uptime because the Ethereum blockchain operates continuously so as long as the Ethereum blockchain is still operating the Uniswap Interface will continue to operate.

- Uniswap was the first widely-used permissionless decentralized exchange (DEX) that allowed users to trade between any ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum network. This allowed for trading without the need for deposits or withdrawals to a centralized order book.

- Uniswap aims to serve digital asset holders who prefer self-custody, high liquidity on their exchange and the freedom to choose from far more trading pairs that any centralized exchange can offer. Uniswap uses the Constant Product Market Maker Model (CPMMM) which allows them to always provide liquidity regarless of order size or the size of the liquidity pool.

- The main distincion between Uniswap and other DEXs is their CPMMM pricing model which allows for any ERC20 token to be traded so long as an equivalent value of ETH is added. Uniswap uses the constant equation of x * y = k where x and y represent the quantity of ETH and ERC20 tokens in the liquidity pool and k is a constant. This automates the pricing and maintains access to liquidity.

- Uniswap V3, which launched in May of 2021, allows for liquidity providers to create as many positions as they see fit, each with their own price range. This allows the market to concentrate liquidity where it sees fit.

## **Landscape**
- Uniswap is in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) domain.
- Bitcoin is commonly thought of as the launchpad for DeFi when in 2009 an anonymous entity, calling themself/themselves Satoshi Nakamoto, launched their peer-to-peer digital monetary system that operates on the blockchain. 
- In 2017, MakerDAO, an Ethereum-based protocol, allowed users to issue a cryptocurrency 1-to-1 to the United States Dollar by using digital assets as collateral. This allowed for anyone to borrow the DAI stablecoin against ETH, paving the way for decentralized loans. Lenders collecting interest payments no longer had to be financial institutions and borrowers no longer could be denied access to funds based on things such as credit history, country of origin or race.

### **Other Companies in DeFi**
#### Compound Finance
- "Compound Finance is a marketplace used by crypto investors to lend and borrow their digital assets. Compound crypto is a decentralized protocol, or dApp, built on a blockchain."

#### Balancer
- "Balancer is an automated market maker (AMM) that allows users to create liquidity pools with up to eight different tokens in any ratio. Balancer pools can be thought of as automatically rebalancing portfolios, wherein anyone can create or join a decentralized index fund and fees go to liquidity providers instead of intermediary fund managers. The Balancer protocol is governed by the Balancer (BAL) token, which can be earned via liquidity mining by depositing cryptocurrencies into Balancer’s liquidity pools."

### Synthetix
- "Synthetix is a synthetic asset protocol that allows for the issuance of synthetic assets on Ethereum. You could think of a synthetic asset as a kind of derivative product. It gives you a way to get exposure to an asset without having to own it."
- "The idea is that by using Synthetix, traders can get exposure to certain assets that don’t exist on-chain. Synthetix also allows for the creation of indexes like the DeFi index, which tracks the price of a basket of multiple DeFi assets."

### Curve Finance
- "Like Uniswap, Curve is a decentralized exchange for trading cryptocurrency assets. The key difference between them is that on Uniswap, you can swap any ERC-20 token (as long as there’s liquidity), whereas Curve is specifically for trading stablecoins on Ethereum."

### Yearn.Finance
- "...yearn.finance capitalizes on a practice commonly called “yield farming,” in which users lock up crypto assets in a DeFi protocol in order to earn more cryptocurrency. The more assets users lock in a platform, the more tokens they are awarded by the protocols."

## **Results**
- Uniswap paved the way for decentralized exchanges to give digital asset traders another option for doing business instead of having to utilize centralized exchanges such as Coinbase, Gemini or Binance. DEXs are able to outcompete centralized exchanges because they are able to be more permissionless and often offer lower fees.
- Apart from fees, Total Value Locked (TVL) is a common metric to compare the market penetration of DeFi protocols. Uniswap, as of the time of writing this, ranks 7th in TVL with $8.29B locked. This makes them the 2nd largest DEX in terms of TVL behind only Curve Finance with $14.22B locked.

## **Recommendations**
- Uniswap seems to be hindered in the fact that they are only able to swap tokens that are on native to the Ethereum network. With other Ethereum competitors gaining popularity, such as Cardano and the Binance Smart Chain, I think it would drive more business to Uniswap to expand their offerings. 
- This would benefit Uniswap because it would truly become the one-stop-shop for swapping any digital assets. Without the restrictions to a single network, Uniswap would be able to service everyone. 
- A way to accomplish this would be to incorporate other projects that allow for interoporability between different blockchains, such as Polkadot, which enables cross-blockchain transfers  of any type of data or asset.

- Uniswap has shown that they are constantly evolving with the recent voting that appears to be migrating the protocol to the Polygon Network which is a layer 2 solution that interacts with the Ethereum network. By incorporating Polygon, Uniswap will be able to solve one of their largest problems which is the high gas fees associated the the Ethereum network.
